Revision History:
File created on 28 Jul 2010.

The module statevector implements the data structure and methods needed to work with state vectors (a set of unknown parameters to be optimized by a DA system) of different lengths, types, and configurations. Two baseclasses together form a generic framework:
    * :class:`~da.baseclasses.statevector.StateVector`
    * :class:`~da.baseclasses.statevector.EnsembleMember`

As usual, specific implementations of StateVector objects are done through inheritance form these baseclasses. An example of designing 
your own baseclass StateVector we refer to :ref:`tut_chapter5`.

class StateVector(object):
    """ 
    The StateVector object first of all contains the data structure of a statevector, defined by 3 attributes that define the 
    dimensions of the problem in parameter space:
        * nlag
        * nparameters
        * nmembers

    The fourth important dimension `nobs` is not related to the StateVector directly but is initialized to 0, and later on 
    modified to be used in other parts of the pipeline:
        * nobs

    These values are set as soon as the :meth:`~da.baseclasses.statevector.StateVector.setup` is called from the :ref:`pipeline`. 
    Additionally, the value of attribute `isOptimized` is set to `False` indicating that the StateVector holds a-priori values 
    and has not been modified by the :ref:`optimizer`.

    StateVector objects can be filled with data in two ways
        1. By reading the data from file
        2. By creating the data through a set of method calls

    Option (1) is invoked using method :meth:`~da.baseclasses.statevector.StateVector.read_from_file`. 
    Option (2) consists of a call to method :meth:`~da.baseclasses.statevector.StateVector.make_new_ensemble`

    Once the StateVector object has been filled with data, it is used in the pipeline and a few more methods are
    invoked from there:
        * :meth:`~da.baseclasses.statevector.StateVector.propagate`, to advance the StateVector from t=t to t=t+1
        * :meth:`~da.baseclasses.statevector.StateVector.write_to_file`, to write the StateVector to a NetCDF file for later use

    The methods are described below:

    .. automethod:: da.baseclasses.statevector.StateVector.setup 
    .. automethod:: da.baseclasses.statevector.StateVector.read_from_file
    .. automethod:: da.baseclasses.statevector.StateVector.write_to_file
    .. automethod:: da.baseclasses.statevector.StateVector.make_new_ensemble
    .. automethod:: da.baseclasses.statevector.StateVector.propagate
    .. automethod:: da.baseclasses.statevector.StateVector.write_members_to_file

    Finally, the StateVector can be mapped to a gridded array, or to a vector of TransCom regions, using:

    .. automethod:: da.baseclasses.statevector.StateVector.grid2vector
    .. automethod:: da.baseclasses.statevector.StateVector.vector2grid
    .. automethod:: da.baseclasses.statevector.StateVector.vector2tc
