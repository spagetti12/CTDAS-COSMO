Revision History:
File created on 06 Sep 2010.

The Platform class is found in the module :mod:`platform`, or in a specific implementation under the da/source tree. 

The platform object holds attributes and methods that allow job control on each specific platform. This includes methods to create and submit jobs, but also to obtain process and/or job ID's. These are needed to control the flow of 
the system on each platform.

Typically, every platform needs specific implementations of this object (through inheritance), and you should refer to your specific Platform object documentation for details (see *da/platform/*).

        Returns the job template for a given computing system, and fill it with options from the dictionary provided as argument.
        The job template should return the preamble of a job that can be submitted to a queue on your platform, 
        examples of popular queuing systems are:
            - SGE
            - MOAB
            - XGrid
            -

        A list of job options can be passed through a dictionary, which are then filled in on the proper line,
        an example is for instance passing the dictionary {'account':'co2'} which will be placed 
        after the ``-A`` flag in a ``qsub`` environment.

        An extra option ``block`` has been added that allows the job template to be configured to block the current
        job until the submitted job in this template has been completed fully.
