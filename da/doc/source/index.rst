Welcome to the CTDAS documentation!
===================================

This is the starting page for the documentation of the CarbonTracker Data Assimilation Shell (CTDAS).

.. sidebar:: What is CTDAS?

    CTDAS is short for "CarbonTracker Data Assimilation Shell". 
    This is the implementation of an extendible data assimilation framework for CarbonTracker,
    developed by NOAA ESRL & Wageningen University, in close cooperation with many partners around the world.

The aim of the CTDAS system is to facilitate the use of CarbonTracker, and to 
foster its development by its many international partners. At its most basic, the CTDAS is a simple 
control system for CarbonTracker that deals with the running, optimization, analysis, and time stepping of the system. 
For advanced users, the CTDAS provides an easy way to extend or modify the system by introducing new configurations 
for the state vector, for the observations, or even for the transport model or optimization method.

The CarbonTracker development team welcomes suggestions and feedback on the CTDAS system, and its documentation.
